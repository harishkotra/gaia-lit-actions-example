# Lit Protocol + Gaia Integration Example

This example demonstrates how to integrate Lit Protocol's programmable signing with Gaia's LLM API.

The application:
1. Fetches real-time weather data
2. Uses Gaia's LLM to get clothing recommendations
3. Uses Lit Protocol to sign transactions when temperature is above 60Â°F
